# TipTracker (web version)

## Overview
A comprehensive application to help delivery drivers track earned tips.  This web version is a precursor to a future  mobile app, and possibly another version that will expand even further to allow tracking of expenses for budgeting purposes, tasks to complete, personal notes, creative projects, and other facets of a user's life.



### Basic Features
* **User Account:** Users will be able to create an account to contain all of their information. A confirmation email will be sent with a link to confirm account. User information will only be accessible by signing into their account with the correct email and password.

* **Tip/Income Entry:** Each tip entry will contain fields for date/time of entry, order number, customer name, customer address, order total, tip amount, tip type (cash or credit).

* **Search/Sort:** Tip entries will be searchable by all fields so that the user can find past entries for a single customer by name or address.  Entries should also be sortable by category so users can browse through a chronological list of entries or view alphabetically by customer name.

* **Daily Totals:** Users will be able to view daily totals in various categories: number of deliveries, total sales, total tips (cash and/or credit), and hours worked.  Average tip amounts and number of deliveries per hour will also be calculated and shown.

* **Weekly/Monthly Break-downs:** Users will be able to view totals and averages by week, month. Yearly or custom date ranges may be available as well.


### Possible Future Features
* **Graphic Visualization of Data and Calendar:** Users will be able to view data in graphs or charts to easily find trends or patterns in business.  A calendar view would also be helpful for users to see entries by chronology.
